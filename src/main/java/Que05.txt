What is a distributed system?

A distributed system is a network that consists of autonomous computers/nodes that are physically separate but
linked together using the network or any distribution middleware. All the nodes can share data in between and optimize
the computing time.

What kind of difficulties commonly found when building a distributed system?
1. Security: It is difficult to provide adequate security in distributed systems because
the nodes as well as the connections need to be secured.
2. Heterogeneity: Heterogeneity of networks, computer hardware, OS, languages etc.
3. Concurrency: multiple nodes can try to access same data at the same time.
4. Consistency: failure of some node might result in invalid results.

How do you solve these difficulties?

1. Using cryptography, providing access policies(access control models) and/or using firewalls.
2. Using middlewares like redHat or open source like Apache.
3. Using concurrency practices(using locks or synchronization) can help concurrency failures.
4. Using data replication can resolve consistency issue.
